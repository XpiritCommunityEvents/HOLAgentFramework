# Unlock the Potential of AI in Your Applications with Semantic Kernel

Authors: Marcel de Vries, Roy Cornelissen, Rene van Osnabrugge ([Xebia](https://xebia.com))

Welcome! This file helps you (the workshop participant) to quickly understand the repository layout and find the exercises, starters, and final solutions used during the workshop.

## Workshop agenda

The workshop is structured into five modules. In these modules you will follow a mix of theory and hands-on labs.

- [Module 0: Workshop Introduction and Prerequisites](./exercises/module0/README.md)
- [Module 1: Behind the Curtain of AI Models](./exercises/module1/README.md)
- [Module 2: Backstage with Semantic Kernel](./exercises/module2/README.md)
- [Module 3: Orchestration of AI Agents](./exercises/module3/README.md)
- [Module 4: Amplify Performance with Retrieval Augmented Generation](./exercises/module4/README.md)
- [Module 5: Semantic Kernel in Concert](./exercises/module5/README.md)

## Where to start
Start at the [Exercises and labs](./exercises/README.md) to find all hands-on labs and module-specific markdown guides.

- `exercises/` — hands-on labs and module-specific markdown guides.
- `prompts/` — Example prompts and prompt engineering notes used in the labs.
- `src/` — Supporting code and sample projects used across the workshop (e.g., `HolSemanticKernel` project)

## Notes for participants
- Use the top-level `README.md` to follow the workshop agenda and module timings.
- Each module folder in `exercises/` contains step-by-step lab instructions. Look for `HOL*-*.md` files.
- Throughout the exercises there wil be some references to datasets/ You can find these in the `exercises/datasets/` folder.
- Start projects are in each module's `start/` folder with incomplete code to be filled in during the labs.
- Final projects live in each module's `final/` folder and are runnable .NET projects with solution files and sample data.
- If you want to run any .NET sample, open the `.sln` file in the corresponding `final/` folder in Visual Studio or use `dotnet run` from the project directory.
